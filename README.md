# What-to-Cook (WTC)
WTC is my own selfish idea turned into reality. I've always loved cooking
and have often spent time wandering around my kitchen looking at ingredients wondering what I could make. Learning to code gave me the tools to create a solution to this problem.
<br>
WTC is still in the development process and will be updated as time allows.
<br>
<br>
WTC was built with a variety of technologies.
The backend is based on an flask database with python.
The frontend is built on a react-redux framework. CSS was used to style the site.

<br>
WTC is available for testing and viewing at https://what-to-cook.onrender.com/.
If installing locally you must have the root folder What-to-Cook(back-end) running with pipenv run flask run and the react-app folder(front-end) running with npm start.
